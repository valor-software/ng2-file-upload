## Quick start

1. A recommended way to install ***ng2-file-upload*** is through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=ng2-file-upload) package manager using the following command:

  `npm i ng2-file-upload --save`

  Alternatively, you can [download it in a ZIP file](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload/archive/master.zip).

2. Currently `ng2-file-upload` contains two directives: `ng2-file-select` and `ng2-file-drop`. `ng2-file-select` is used for 'file-input' field of form and
  `ng2-file-drop` is used for area that will be used for dropping of file or files.

3. More information regarding using of ***ng2-file-upload*** is located in
  [demo](http://valor-software.github.io/ng2-file-upload/) and [demo sources](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload/tree/master/demo).

## API for `ng2FileSelect`

### Properties

  - `uploader` - (`FileUploader`) - uploader object. See using in [demo](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload/blob/master/demo/components/file-upload/simple-demo.ts)

## API for `ng2FileDrop`

### Properties

  - `uploader` - (`FileUploader`) - uploader object. See using in [demo](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload/blob/master/demo/components/file-upload/simple-demo.ts)

  Parameters supported by this object:

  1. `url` - URL of File Uploader's route
  2. `authToken` - Auth token that will be applied as 'Authorization' header during file send.
  3. `disableMultipart` - If 'true', disable using a multipart form for file upload and instead stream the file. Some APIs (e.g. Amazon S3) may expect the file to be streamed rather than sent via a form. Defaults to false.
  4. `itemAlias` - item alias (form name redefenition)

### Events

  - `fileOver` - it fires during 'over' and 'out' events for Drop Area; returns `boolean`: `true` if file is over Drop Area, `false` in case of out.
